## How it works

This project is a hardware-accelerated Regular Expression (Regex) Matcher. Unlike software regex engines that evaluate patterns sequentially and suffer from backtracking, this hardware design compiles the regex into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) where **every possible state is evaluated simultaneously in parallel**.

The matcher is hardcoded in silicon to detect a simplified email address format: `[a-z]+@[a-z]+\.com`. 

The design streams 8-bit ASCII characters (one per clock cycle) and uses simple combinational comparators to check for character classes (like `a-z`, `@`, and `.`). The progression through the regex is tracked by a series of Flip-Flops. Because the pattern is unanchored, the state machine actively searches for a valid substring match on every single clock cycle.

## How to test

1. Provide an active clock signal (`clk`) and hold `rst_n` low to reset the NFA state machine.
2. Set `rst_n` high to begin operation.
3. Stream an ASCII string into the 8 input pins (`ui_in`), providing exactly one character per clock cycle.
4. Monitor the `match` pin (`uo_out[0]`). It will pulse HIGH for exactly 1 clock cycle immediately after the final `m` in `.com` is received, indicating a successful match.

For example, streaming `hello@tapeout.com` will result in a match, while `hello@tapeoutcom` will not.

The remaining output pins (`uo_out[1:6]`) are connected directly to the internal state Flip-Flops, allowing you to visually debug the NFA's progression through the regex if hooked up to LEDs!

## External hardware

- Any microcontroller (like an Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico) to stream the 8-bit parallel ASCII data into the `ui_in` pins at the desired clock rate.
- (Optional) LEDs connected to the `uo_out` pins to visualize the state machine progression and the final match.
